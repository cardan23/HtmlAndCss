Text elements

<p> - paragraph
    this tag is to show some text on the web page

<em> - emphasize
    this tag is to emphasize a text (italic text)

<i> - italic (deprecated)
    this tag is to show italic text, same as <em> tag. The difference here is "i" tag
    is deprecated and we should not use it anymore due to we should use tags only for 
    structure not for styles.

<strong>
    The strong element represents strong importance, seriousness, or urgency for its contents.

<b> - bold (deprecated)
    similar to "strong" tag, just is deprecated, we should not use it anymore due to we should use tags only for 
    structure not for styles.

Heading
<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6> 
    
    For this heading we use this tags for know a hierarchy of elements, not for size as is very common on web pages.
    We should only use one <h1> tag on our web pages, this to let the search engines fine in a better way our page,
    nothing happens if we use more than one but is a good practice use a single <h1> element.
