Entities

    Entities on Html are special chars and we need to write them with a particular way.

    For example if we want to show <> (angle brackets) on the page will not be possible
    due to the web browser translate this as part of the structure of web page.

    All Entities on html starts with & and ends with ";".

    For exaple to apply angle brackets we need to write something like below:

        < -- less than
            &lt;

        > -- greater than
            &gt;
