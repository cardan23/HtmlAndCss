Images

We can get some free images from the next link: unsplash.com

For set images o our html code we can use the tag <img>

we have some attributes on this tag like, source:

src --> this is the link/path of the image.
alt --> To provide text description of the image
    Alt property is important to make more descriptive the html file.
    another good reason is to let the browsers now about it and in case something with source fails 
    we will show this description on screen.

with --> css property to set a with size of image.
heigth --> css css property to set a heigth size of image.

New! Special property

object-fit --> css property wich helps to crop or fit the image without disort it with the given sizes before.
