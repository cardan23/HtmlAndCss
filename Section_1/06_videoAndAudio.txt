Video and Audio

We can get some free video from the next site: https://www.pexels.com/

<video> is used to set some video content into html, the same way as <audio>
<audio> is used to set some audio into html content.

src --> this is the link/path of the audio/video
constrols --> specify if we want to show controls into video/audio like "play", "stop", "volume", etc.
autoplay --> to start the video/audio when the page load
loop --> repeat the video again and again

IMPORTANT!

We can check the compatibility of html elements with web browsers
and know if we can use it or if will be work fine for our purposes.
