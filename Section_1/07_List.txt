List

In HTML we have diferent elements for List, next we can show some of them:

<ul>
    un-ordered list, wich means the order of items doesn't matter

    <li>
        List item, inside every list we will have items and we will use "li" tag for each one.

<ol>
    ordered list, wich means the order of items matter
    <li>

<dl> 
    Description list, we can add to list some tems and several descriptions by term. I mean we can have a bunch of description on each term.
    <dt> --> detail term
    <dd> --> detail description
