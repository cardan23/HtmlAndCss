Semantic Elements

This elements are containers like "div" or "span", those are generic containers. However, HTML introduced some containers that are more descriptive or meaningful
for the html file.

Commonly those semantic elements are used on post, news web pages, blogs, etc. But not necessary we can use only on this kind of pages. 

<article>
	An article could be any independent, self-contained content
	for example:
		Forum post
		Comments
		Reviews
		Product carts
<figure>
	This container doesn't have any visual caracteristics its just semantic element and more descriptive element to tell the content of this element.
	The <figure> tag specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc.

<mark>
	This semanting element is pretty similar to use "span" element to highlight a piece of text, the difference with mark is we dont need to use any css property
	to highlight the text, by default is marked with yellow. With this we can know in a better way this is only to hightlight the text.
<time>
	this is a semantic element used to dates on html pages, no visual changes just helps to search engines find in a best way our web page, and for programmers
	identify what is that element about.
