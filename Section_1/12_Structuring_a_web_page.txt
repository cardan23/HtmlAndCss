Structuring a web page

    We use some structural base elements into html, some typical are the next ones:

    <header>
    <body>
    <footer>

    But apart from these previous elements we have more elements that could be more descriptive like below:

    <main>
        Inisde body tag we can have a main element wich means this is the container with the main information of the web page.
        Any page should have only one main element.

    <aside>
        We should use this element to representing content not related directly with main element.

    <section>
        This element is to represent a section or diferent sections into a part of the web page, for example:
        products, orders, customers, billing, etc... All of these are sections that could be represented and separated
        semantically on the html source code.
