Providing css

There are some ways to provide a css file (styles) into our html file, here we can see the next ones:

1. Embedded stylesheets
    This means have the css code into the html file. 

2. External stylesheets
    We can call with a reference stylesheet file from our html code but into separated files.

3. Inline styles
    This means apply the styles directly into a particular html element.
