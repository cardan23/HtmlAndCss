Normalizing CSS


This is a css file available on internet that let us normalize the css styles on all web browsers.

With this we mean, web browsers have different ways to render web pages and with this file we set all css properties to have the same css styles
into all web browsers.

For example:

mozila firefox adds a margin on the left of 10px by default on all web pages, this behavior donÂ´t happens into google chrome,
so with this file we remove that style by default and we have the same result into all web browsers.
