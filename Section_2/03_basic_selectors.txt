Selectors

into css we have several Selectors, we listed below:

1. Type
2. ID
3. Class
4. Attribute


Type
    To refer type of element we only need to write the name of the element, like this:
        div {
            //styles here
        }

ID
    To refer type of element we only need to have a '#' and then the id of the element, like this:
        #product {
            //styles here
        }

    The id should be unique for the element, we cannot use the same Id for another element into the page.

Class
    To refer type of element we only need to have a '.' and then the class of the element, like this:
        .product {
            //styles here
        }

    we can use the same class for another element into the page, we can reuse the class styles.

Attribute
    To refer type of element we only need to have the type of the element and then the attribute of the element '[atribute]' , like this:
        a [target] {
            //styles here
        }
