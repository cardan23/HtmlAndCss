Relational Selectors

    This kind of selectors are used to apply styles to elements that are related like siblings or a child of an element.
    we can use these selectors with no questions but we need to be careful because it can be like this:

    Fragile:
        This kind of elements depends on the positions that have as reference another selector, if one of those elements change of place
        our style will broke and fail. So this is one of the reasons we need to be careful of this. Only if we are sure about the positions
        and relations of html elements we can apply it.

    Slow:
        Normal or common selectors like id, type or class selectoris faster than relational selector, this is because we can find directly
        with this parameter that identify the element, but with relational selectors, we depend on other elements and their position to browsers
        be able to apply the styles, so this last procedure takes more time with large web pages.
