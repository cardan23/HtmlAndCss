Pseudo element selectors

    This is pretty similar to pseudo class selectors but the difference is here:

    Pseudo element selector --> To style part of an element
        Example:
            First letter of a web paragraph

    Pseudo class selector --> To style elements in a particular state.
        Exapmle:
            Hovered anchor

    The syntanxis of a pseudo element is the next one:

    selector::pseudo-element {
      property: value;
    }

    please check html and css file to see some examples of these selectors.
