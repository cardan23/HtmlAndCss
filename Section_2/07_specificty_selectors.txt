Specificty Selectors

    On Selectors we have a hierarchy, css will apply changes to more specific selector.

    1. ID selector
    2. Class selector
    3. Element selector

    Css will apply changes into that order, first will check id selectors, then class selectors and at the end 
    element selectors.

    We can combine selectors like elements and class selector and be more specific and css will apply changes into 
    that hierarchy.

    Please check the examples into html and css files.
