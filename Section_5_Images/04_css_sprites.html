    <!-- With this approach the web browser is sending 1 http get request for each image, this could be hard on a web site with hundred of images
    can be a slow web page due to loading images, for this reason we will have the solution with sprites technique-->
    <img src="Images/dishes.png" alt="">
    <img src="Images/landing.png" alt="">
    <img src="Images/rocketship.png" alt="">
    <img src="Images/saturn.png" alt="">
    <img src="Images/ufo.png" alt="">

     <!--
    CSS Sprite    
        
    https://cssspritestool.com/
    or search on goolge css sprites generator to find another sprites generator

    this tool will combine multiple images into a sigle one 

    Only 1 http request for same images

    this can have some problems too is not perfect

    Problems:
        File size can get too large
        Sprites are not flexible
        we should use this only for small images and some icons
